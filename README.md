This repository contains some small prototypes i wrote for my bachelor thesis titled "Untersuchung von MÃ¶glichkeiten zur Entwicklung von Multiplattform-Desktopanwendungen mit modernen Webtechnologien" ("examination of options for the development of cross platform desktop applications with modern web technologies").
It examines possible ways to develop cross platform desktop apps with web technologies (html, css, javascript) and focuses on creating single page web applications and running them with NW.js and atom-electron.
